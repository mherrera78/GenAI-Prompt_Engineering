It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).        Hyperfractionated radiation therapy     Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily dose of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.</td>\n",

Get Regular Eye Exams Be sure to have regular comprehensive eye exams. If you are age 60 or older, you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Eye exams can help detect cataracts and other age-related eye problems at their earliest stages. In addition to cataract, your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other vision disorders. For many eye diseases, early treatment may save your sight. For more on comprehensive eye exams, see the chapter on Symptoms and Detection. Quit Smoking Ask your doctor for help to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Wear Sunglasses Ultraviolet light from the sun may contribute to the development of cataracts. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays when you're outdoors. Take Care of Other Health Problems Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts. Maintain a Healthy Weight If your current weight is a healthy one, work to maintain it by exercising most days of the week. If you're overweight or obese, work to lose weight slowly by reducing your calorie intake and increasing the amount of exercise you get each day. Choose a Healthy Diet Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Adding a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting a lot of vitamins and nutrients. Fruits and vegetables are full of antioxidants, which in theory could prevent damage to your eye's lens. Studies haven't proven that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts. But fruits and vegetables have many proven health benefits and are a safe way to increase the amount of vitamins in your diet.

       "      <td>The inheritance pattern of restless legs syndrome is usually unclear because many genetic and environmental factors can be involved. The disorder often runs in families: 40 to 90 percent of affected individuals report having at least one affected first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, and many families have multiple affected family members. Studies suggest that the early-onset form of the disorder is more likely to run in families than the late-onset form.  In some affected families, restless legs syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance suggests that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, the genetic changes associated with restless legs syndrome in these families have not been identified.</td>\n",

    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- In some instances, the result provided from the pre-trained model is very general and does not offer a high level of detail relative to the original question asked.   In contrast, the fine-tune model, goes into a higher level of detail to anser the question.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In some cases, when the pre-trained model does not have a lot of information, it offers just a reference link.  However, the fine-tuned model once again, offers a higher detailed level in the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In some cases, the pre-trained model seems to be just paraphrasing the same question (I would argue that the model hallucinates).  In contrast, the fine-tune model continues to offer a detailed explanation, but also provides answers that are coherent and make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was evident that in some instances, the pre-trained model is able to provide very limited answers in form of a list, for example, to the question *\"Is Blau syndrome inherited?\"* the pre-trained model answers **Yes, Blau Syndrome is inherited** . Whereas the fine-tune model would not only provide the correct answer, but it will add more context that made the answer more meaninful and *complete*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- With all this being said, it's important to note that a fine-tuned model is not always going to be able to provide the best quality answer.  I was able to observe in some rows that the fine-tuned model was **not able** to provide with an adecuate answer. In some cases the fine-tuned model would *hallucinate*, and in some other cases, the answers will be limited or vague.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "It is evident, even with such a small sample of answers that the fine-tuned model **outperforms** the pre-trained model. The difference is very evident, even in the case of a **modest** fine-tune effort like the one conducted here.  For reference, the dataset used to fine-tune was only consisting of 2,000 rows and the number of **epocs was only 5**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I can say with a high degree of confidence that on a much more *\"serious\"* effort, with thousands of new medical rows and with a high degree of epocs, the fine-tune model will outperform the original model significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I would like to say that eventhough the results of this relatively simple fine-tuning exercise were evident and the performance achieved was very significant, it is important to note the **cost** associated with a proper fine-tuning exercise, where we would have to have enough computing resources available or a relatively large budget to outsorce assets to conduct the fine-tuning.    \n",
    "\n",
    "A cost/benefit analysis of such exercise should always be considered to assess the feasibility and guarantee an acceptable ROI.\n",
